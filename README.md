# LLM Application - Parody Literature Creator

## Objective
The objective is to apply the knowledge of prompt engineering and leverage the OpenAI API, along with the Langchain Python library, to create a practical and innovative NLP application powered by a large language model (LLM). 

## Problem Statement
I'd like to create a chat-based novel that draws inspiration from well-known works of literature, movies, anime, and cartoons. In this project, I'll be altering the genre and infusing it with a specific moral message. The format I'll be adopting is akin to parody literature, where I'll take existing, popular texts and recontextualize them to explore fresh themes and perspectives
